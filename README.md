# Generate Image border for videos 

I recently started creating photos tutorials on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU9heILIb402P-STGRZVghA) and one of the problems I faced using Premiere Pro was creating borders around images because it's not an option that is included. I tried using different photo editing softwares but the process was cumbersome and required doing math.

# What my app includes
- Offline by default
- Resizes the images (small size at 2200px)
- Customizable border size
- View the result in a 16x9 frame
- Automatic scale calculation for Premiere Pro

# Releases
You can download the latest version on the [releases](https://github.com/loic294/generate-image-border/releases) page.

# Tech motivation
I decided to create this to test new technologies I never used. I decided to use Electron because I wanted the app to be offline by default and knew I needed to have an unrestricted access to the file system to read and write files. I wanted to use Frabric to quickly have components that look good both on Windows and Mac with looking too much like a web app.
